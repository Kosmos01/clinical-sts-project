# clinical-sts-project

Project goal: Within the health informatics domain, we leverage semenatic textual similarity (STS) to identify similar clinical texts that acn be found in Electronic Health Records

Approach: Utilize medical entity identifiers (cTAKES, CLAMP), feature engineer, word embedding models, contextual representations, along with five regression/classification algorithms

Significance: It is imperative to enable machines to not only score how similar texts are, but to also have scores that correlate with clinicians' identifications so as to preserve any critical information

Scripts modified and implemented from others' github code: 
tokenization.py, modeling.py, extract_features.py, berts.py
